# LINK LOCKER

I have a lot of random bookmarks.  I've been using [Wallabag](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag) for saving links but I realized that I don't need a "read later" application.  I just want something intuitive that I can use to save links.

- Open source and self hosted
- Save bookmarks
- Organize in folders
- Add tags
- Import links from Wallabag - *currently via shell script not included in the repo but if interested let me know*
## Technology

- *Frontend* - [Lit](https://lit.dev/) web components
- *Backend* - NestJS
	- The default setup uses a SQLite database but can be used with MySQL or PostgreSQL
## Links
